            I am an aspiring economist and software developer, currently honing
            my skills through a blend of academic and practical experiences. I
            hold a Bachelor degree in Economic Sciences and Management from
            Université Ibn Zohr, a program that has provided me with a robust
            understanding of economic theories and their real-world
            applications. Complementing my economics background, I have also
            specialized in IT development, earning a diploma as a Specialized
            Technician in Software Development from ITIAM.

        At Université Ibn Zohr, I delved deep into the intricacies of economic
        principles, learning to analyze, interpret, and provide solutions to
        complex economic problems. My coursework covered a wide range of
        subjects, from micro and macroeconomics to financial management and
        business strategy.

        Parallel to my studies in economics, I pursued a technical diploma in
        software development at ITIAM. This intensive program equipped me with
        hands-on experience in various programming languages, software
        development methodologies, and project management techniques. I
        developed a solid foundation in creating efficient, scalable, and
        user-friendly software solutions.
